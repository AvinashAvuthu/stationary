    Computes the entropy rate given the edges of the process and the stationary distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    edges: list of tuples or function
        The transitions of the process, either a list of (source, target,
        transition_probability), or an edge_function that takes two parameters,
        the source and target states, to the transition transition probability.
        If using an edge_function you must supply the states of the process.
    q_d: float, 1
        parameter that specifies which divergence function to use
    states: list, None
        States for use with the edge_func
    stationary: dictionary
        Precomputed stationary distribution
